-- "Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska founded the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston in 1862. Its significance was threefold. First, there was no other institution of its kind offering clinical internship experience to women. Second, since the hospital was staffed exclusively by women physicians, it offered the opportunity, as she phrased it, \u201cto demonstrate that women could be successful physicians.\u201d Third, It was also unique as the first to offer clinical internships to women. Because of her efforts, many women, who would otherwise never have the opportunity, were able to enter the medical field. The hospital recorded another \u201cfirst\u201d when it hired Anita Tyng as a surgeon, the first time in American history that a woman was listed officially as specializing in surgery. In 1872, she established a nursing program, gaining recognition as the first general training school for nurses in America. One of the first graduates was Linda Richards who was the first formally trained nurse in the United States. She eventually became a leader in developing curricula for nursing training throughout the United States and participated in the organization of the Bellevue Training School in New York. In 1875 the New England Hospital graduated the first African-American nurse in the United States, Mary Elizabeth Mahoney. Other graduates included Dr. Mary Putnam-Jacobi, the first woman admitted to the prestigious School of Medicine in Paris; Dr. Sophia Jax-Blake who subsequently establishing the London School of Medicine for Women; and Dr. Elizabeth Mosher who went on to be appointed the First Dean of Students and Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan. Due largely to her constant campaigning, in 1879 the all-male Massachusetts Medical Society, reluctantly voted to admit women to membership on equal terms with men. This was especially important because in Boston at the time city directories listed physicians under three categories\u2014\u201cMembers of the Massachusetts Medical Society,\u201d \u201cPhysicians,\u201d and \u201cPhysicians-Female.\u201d The Physicians-Female category included not only those with medical degrees but also clairvoyants, midwives, and others. To separate themselves from women marginally educated in medicine, if at all, and to have their medical expertise sanctioned by their peers, women physicians naturally sought comparable admittance to medical societies. This was a major breakthrough in legitimizing female physicians in the eye of the general public. Zakrzewska\u2019s pioneering efforts broke many barriers that opened the medical field to female practitioners at every level from nursing to surgeons.",
-- "The female nurses and physicians trained at Zakrzewska's teaching hospital spread her influence throughout the US and internationally. Dr. Mary Putnam-Jacobi became the first woman admitted to the prestigious School of Medicine in Paris and founded the Association for the Advancement of the Medical Education of Women. Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake established the London School of Medicine for Women modeled on what she learned from Zakrzewska. Dr. Amanda Sanford Hickey, who interned at the New England Hospital, went on to become the first female graduate of the University of Michigan Medical School. Dr. Elizabeth Mosher became the first Dean of Students and Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan, which founded its own nursing program. Linda Richard, after having studied and graduated from the New England Hospital Nursing School in 1873, went on to found other formal nursing schools and become a leader in nursing in the United States. She developed the first system for charting and maintaining individual patient medical records. Mary Elizabeth Mahoney in 1908 co-founded the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses. As the first president of the New England Hospital Medical Society, the first medical society in the world formed by women, Zakrzewska exerted continuing pressure that led medical societies throughout the US to begin admitting female physicians and also led to the Johns Hopkins University establishing an endowment for female medical education and opening its doors to women in 1891. Historian Virginia Drachman, in her Hospital with a Heart: Women Doctors and the Paradox of Separatism at the New England Hospital 1862-1969, concluded that Zakrzewska \u201cturned the New England Hospital into one of the most important women\u2019s medical institutions in the nineteenth century.\u201d As such, it served as a model for women\u2019s medical education and practical application.",
-- "Zakrzewska participated actively, and was to a great extent responsible for, the realization in the United States of quality medical education for women, the gradual opening of professional doors to women seeking careers in medicine, and ultimately their acceptance into that profession. By 1900, almost one-fourth of Boston\u2019s physicians were women and three out of the four medical schools in that city allowed women to matriculate. By the same date, because of her efforts, medical schools across the United States were opening their doors to women and professional medical societies were recognizing them as coequals. As explained in #1 and #2 above, the influence of her efforts spread to other parts of the United States and to Europe. Graduates of the New England Hospital she founded and led established her ideas on quality medical education for women wherever their careers took them. In the same manner that Maya Lin's design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC, inspired a new way to imagine such commemorative statuary, in the same way that Jane Addams\u2019 creation of Hull House in Chicago sparked the settlement house movement, Marie Elizbeth Zakrzewska\u2019s establishment of the New England Hospital for Women and Children spawned a new era in health care for women as well as the education of female physicians and nurses. It was the initial undertaking whose success opened the medical profession to women and led to their acceptance as members of established professional medical societies.",

-- "Zakrzewska was naturalized as a US citizen in the U.S. District Court in Boston on January 28, 1863. She was in the forefront of the fight for female acceptance into the charter of the Massachusetts Medical Society which allowed only male candidates. Women desired this recognition because of the acceptance of their professional qualifications it would inspire among the general public. The Boston city directories at the time listed three categories\u2014\u201cMembers of the Massachusetts Medical Society,\u201d \u201cPhysicians,\u201d and \u201cPhysicians-Female.\u201d The Physicians-Female category included not only those with a medical degree but also clairvoyants, midwives, and others. To separate themselves from women marginally educated in medicine, if at all, and to have their medical expertise sanctioned by their peers, women physicians naturally sought comparable admittance to medical societies. This was the first crack in this \"glass ceiling,\"which led other societies to also open their doors. In addition to her medical contributions, she cosponsored the publication of The Woman\u2019s Journal with Mary L. Booth and was an active participant in the anti-slavery crusade as a close collaborator with William Lloyd Garrison and the radical German editor Karl Heinzen. Her home at 5 Peter Parley Road in the Jamaica Plain area is listed as a site on the Boston Women\u2019s Heritage Trail. As an indication of her importance, more than a dozen articles have focused on her career and influence, as well as three major biographies: Isabel Ross, Child of Destiny: The Life Story of the First Woman Doctor (New York: Harper Brothers, 1949); Arleen Marcia Tuchman, Science Has No Sex: The Life of Marie Zakrzewska, M.D. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2006); and Agnes C. Vietor, ed., A Woman\u2019s Quest; The Life of Marie E. Zakrzewska, M.D. (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1924).");
